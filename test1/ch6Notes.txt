SQL Standard Benefits
    Enable portability between systems
    Reduced traingin costs
    Productivity
    Application longevity
    Reduced dependence on a single vendor
    Cross-system communication
SQL Environment
    Catalog
        A set of schemas that constitute the description of a database
    Schema
        The structure that contains descriptions of objects created by a
        user(base tables, views, constraints)
    Data Definition Language (DDL)
        Commands that define a database, including creating, altering, and 
        dropping tables and establishing constraints
    Data Manipulation Language (DML)
        Commands taht maintain and query a database
    Data Control Language (DCL)
        Commands taht control a database, including administering privileges and committing Data
Types of Commands
    data definition language(DDL)
        used to create, alter, and drop tables
    data manipulation language(DML)
        used to update, insert, modify, and query
    data control language (DCL)
        used by the DBA to grant or revoke privileges, for example
SQL Character Data Types
    CHAR(n)
        fixed-length character data, n characters long; maximum value for n is 2000
            Example: assume firstName is of type CHAR(30); if "Sue" is stored in firstName, it will be padded with 27 blanks to create a string of length 30
    VARCHAR2 (n)
        variable-length character data; maximum size if 4000 bytes
    use CHAR only for fixed-length character ields (like social security numbers and zip codes, for example)
    use VARCHAR2 for variable-length character fields (like names of people, for example)
SQL DDL Commands
    typical DDL commands available include 
        CREATE TABLE 
        DROP TABLE 
        ALTER TABLE
SQL Database Definition
    Major CREATE statements:
        CREATE SCHEMA
            defines a portion of the database owned by a particular userk
        CREATE TABLE
            defines a new table and its columns
        CREATE VIEW 
            defines a logical table from one or more tables or views
    Other CREATE statements: CHARACTER SET, COLLATION, TRANSLATION, ASSERTION, DOMAIN
Steps in Table Creation
    1. Identify data types for attributes
    2. Identify columns that can and cannot be null
    3. Identify columns that must be unique (candidate keys)
    4. Identify primary key-forwign key mates
    5. Determine default values
    6. Identify constraints on columns (domain specifications)
    7. Create the table and associated indexes
Data Integrity Controls
    Referential Integrity
        constraint that ensures taht foregn key values of a table must match primary key values of a related table in 1:M relationships
    Restricting:
        Deletes of primary records
        Updates of primary records
        Inserts of dependent records
